Hey, I'm Connor, also known as Spectre.
I am looking to grow as a developer and eventually get jobs in the software design field, (FAANG mainly). 
I'm learning Python and JavaScript through high school classes and at-home experimentation.
Eventually, I want to learn languages such as c++, so that I can modify games that I love.
